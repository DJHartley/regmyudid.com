Hi 

Unfortunately you have not provided a UDiD or provided the incorrect UDiD the character length must be 40 characters (case sensitive)  please check your UDiD and Resubmit

The system in place is automated and takes the UDiD provided direct from PayPal so unfortunately if you have not provided this information or it is incorrect the only way to get the UDiD registered is to complete the order again making sure the correct information is provided please refer to the following page for help - https://regmyudid.com/how-to-find-my-udid.html 

We are extremely clear on how to check the UDiD and the character length we use an automated system and if incorrect there is nothing we can do about it so it is imperative the correct UDiD is supplied to avoid yourself wasting time and money.

Kindest Regards
RegMyUDiD
